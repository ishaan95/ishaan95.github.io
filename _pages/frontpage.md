Hi, I'm Ishaan! My research interest is primarily in simulation testing of autonomous vehicles. I have completed two Summer internships at [Ford Next](https://fordauthority.com/2022/03/ford-next-created-by-jim-farley-last-year-to-spur-av-tech-development/) (which is Ford's autonomy and mobility division) in the simulation team. The details about my background are mentioned in [my CV](../assets/Ishaan_CV.pdf).

A significant project in my research was [Cruzway](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9304625) where my contribution was in the [procedural road generation tool](https://github.com/AugmentedDesignLab/Sumo2Unreal).
