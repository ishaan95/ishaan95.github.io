Hi, I'm Ishaan! I'm a Ph.D. candidate in [Computational Media](https://engineering.ucsc.edu/departments/computational-media/) at the [Jack Baskin School of Engineering](https://engineering.ucsc.edu) at [University of California, Santa Cruz](https://www.ucsc.edu). My research interest is primarily in simulation testing of autonomous vehicles. I have completed two Summer internships at [Ford Next](https://fordauthority.com/2022/03/ford-next-created-by-jim-farley-last-year-to-spur-av-tech-development/) (which is Ford's autonomy and mobility division) in the simulation team. During my Ph.D. program, I have been a teaching assistant (TA) and instructor for the upper division [Game Technologies](https://catalog.ucsc.edu/en/Current/General-Catalog/Courses/CMPM-Computational-Media/Upper-Division/CMPM-121) course where I had the opportunity to teach Unity and Unreal game engines. In addition, I've also been TA for several other game design and development courses. These details are mentioned in [my CV](../assets/Ishaan_CV.pdf).

My dissertation work is in procedural generation of interesting scenarios for simulation testing of autonomous vehicles. A significant project in my research was [Cruzway](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9304625) where my contribution was in the [procedural road generation tool](https://github.com/AugmentedDesignLab/Sumo2Unreal).
